We recently moved from [Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/) to the [Radboud University Medical Center](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/radboud-institute-for-molecular-life-sciences) in beautiful Nijmegen, the Netherlands. We are currently expanding our [team](/team/) and have openings for [PhD students](https://www.radboudumc.nl/en/vacancies/123901-phd-candidate-quantitative-approaches-to-understanding-mosquito-behavior-and-pathogen-transmi) and postdocs.
