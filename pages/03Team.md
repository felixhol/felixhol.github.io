**Manuela Carnaghi** &mdash; postdoc studying how mosquito behavior responds vector control interventions  

**Felix Evers**  &mdash; postdoc integrating microfluidics and microscopy to better understand the malaria parasite  

**Theo Maire** &mdash; postdoc building 4-star mosquito hotels to capture the mosquito life cycle on film, in the lab as well as in the field 

**Marianna Bacchi**  &mdash; PhD student exploring mosquito decision making in heterogenous environments
