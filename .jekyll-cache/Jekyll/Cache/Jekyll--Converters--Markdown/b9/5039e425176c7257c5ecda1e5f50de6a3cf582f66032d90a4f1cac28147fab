<p>I received my PhD in Biophysics from Delft University of Technology (the Netherlands) using microfabrication to study spatial aspects of bacterial cooperation, colonization, and competition working with <a href="https://ceesdekkerlab.nl/">Cees Dekker</a> and <a href="http://keymerlab.nl/www/">Juan Keymer</a>. After defending my PhD, I did a short postdoc  joint between the labs of <a href="https://gmwgroup.harvard.edu/">George Whitesides</a> (Harvard University) and Cees Dekker (Delft). Subsequently, I changed my focus from bacteria to mosquitoes and moved to Stanford University to work with <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/group/prakash-lab/cgi-bin/labsite/">Manu Prakash</a> on several problems related to mosquito ecology and viral evolution, first as a Rubicon fellow and later as a <a href="https://www.bwfund.org/grant-programs/interfaces-science/career-awards-scientific-interface">BWF CASI</a> fellow. Currently, I am a Marie Curie fellow at the <a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/team/insect-virus-interactions/">Insect-Virus Interactions Unit</a> at Institut Pasteur working with <a href="https://research.pasteur.fr/en/member/louis-lambrechts/">Louis Lambrechts</a>, and starting as a long-term fellow at the Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity (<a href="https://cri-paris.org/">CRI-paris</a>). He develops new technologies to study mosquito biology and leverages these tools to understand the internal and external drivers of mosquito behaviors that are relevant to pathogen transmission.</p>
