Mosquitoes transmit an array of pathogens, making them one of the world’s most deadly animals. Although approximately half the world population is at risk for a mosquito-borne disease, we lack a detailed understanding of many important aspects of mosquito biology. Leveraging biophysical, engineering, and machine vision approaches, we aim to better understand what makes mosquitoes such deadly efficient disease vectors.

Our research [team](/team/) is based at [Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/) and the [Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity](https://research.cri-paris.org), in Paris, France.

Mosquitoes transmit an array of pathogens, making them one of the world’s most deadly animals. Although approximately half the world population is at risk for a mosquito-borne disease, we lack a detailed understanding of many important aspects of mosquito biology. Mosquito-borne pathogens are transmitted during blood feeding, yet despite its crucial role in pathogen transmission, blood feeding behavior remains poorly characterized. We leverage biophysical, engineering, and machine vision approaches to create tools to study questions such as: How do pathogen infections change mosquito behavior? How does the skin microbiome affect biting and blood feeding? What sensory inputs do mosquitoes use to make feeding decisions?
